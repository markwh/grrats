### Datasets

#### Height data

Slopes were determined using a first-order finite difference calculated with respect to the nearest upstream location for a given location and observation date. If this nearest location was greater than 10 km upstream

#### Width data

#### Joined data

Height and width data were combined to produce a dataset comprising `r nlocs_j` locations and `r ndates_j` dates, with a total of `r nobstot_j` concurrent observations of height and width.

### Reach averaging

Since river geometry observations--particularly those of height--are noisy, it is common practice to aggregate node-scale data to reach averages. In the SWOT community, this commonly means averaging observations within a ~10-km fixed window. 

Reach-averaged widths and heights were calculated from taking the median of these respective quantities within each 10 km window. Reach-averaged slopes were calculated as the dividend of reach-averaged $\Delta H$ and reach-averaged $\Delta x$. 


#### Calculation of $\delta A$

Partial cross-sectional area was determined for each 

### Preprocessing

### Determination of sections



### Missing data

Since the data comprise remote-sensed observations, they were not sampled uniformly in time and space. Any pair of locations may have been sampled at a different set of dates. This results in a data matrix with many missing observations. In addition, various problematic or unreliable observations were treated as missing. These included the following:

- Reach-averaged observations comprising fewer than 5 nodes' data
- Times and locations (reaches) with non-positive (looking upstream) slope
- Times and nodes for which the nearest upstream location was greater than 5 km (thus giving a dubious finite-difference slope estimate)



### Bayesian inference

#### Priors



#### Likelihood
