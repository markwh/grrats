Questions for data provider:

1. What is specific format of dates, particularly in height data? I can work out that it is a count from "0000-01-01", but since it has trailing decimals I need some time zone reference so that I can match it up optimally with width dataset's time data, which does not have trailing decimals. I presume the trailing decimals have something to do with overpass time. Should width observations be regarded as daily averages?
